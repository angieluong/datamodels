# Postgres

* Also known as PostgreSQL, Postgres is an **open-source** database. According to it's [website](https://www.postgresql.org/), it is a "...object-relational database system", though upon further research, I have clarified this to mean **relational** database.

* Postgres' hosting model includes **client/server, cloud, local, and embedded** hosting. [This website](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/postgresql/5-ways-to-host-postgresql#third-party-managed-databases) provided great insight into its exact capabilities in terms of hosting!


* Additionally, the instructions listed at [this website](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-jdbc/connecting-to-postgresql-database/) detail how to access the database using Java. This includes having Java installed on our local machine, downloading the PostgreSQL JDBC Driver, and connecting to the database's server using its address (such as `localhost`).
