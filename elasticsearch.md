# ElasticSearch

* ElasticSearch is an **open-source** database with a **document-based** data model. [This link](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) will direct you to their website.
* Similarly to MongoDB, ElasticSearch has the hosting options of client/server, cloud, local, and embedded. This has to do with the history and involvement of MongoDB in the development of ElasticSearch.
* According to [this documentation page](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup.html), ElasticSearch is built with Java and contains a JVM that can be accessed through Java in an included directory and setting an environment variable. In addition, the JDBC driver can also be installed as a way to access the database.
