# MongoDB

* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is an **open-source** database. In addition, it is a non-relational database and instead has a **document-oriented** data model (as clarified [here](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/cassandra-vs-mongodb)).
* This database can be hosted with client/server, cloud, local, and embedded. Detailed walkthroughs of each option were found [here](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/mongodb/5-different-ways-deploy-free-database-mongodb-atlas/).
* In order to access the database using Java, we must download a **MongoDB Java Driver**. I came across this information at [this source](https://www.mongodb.com/languages/java).
