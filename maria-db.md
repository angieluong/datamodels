# MariaDB

* MariaDB is an **open-source**, **relational** database. Its [website](https://mariadb.org/) has a lot of helpful information, including links to their Blog and Documentation.
* Despite it being an open-source database, MariaDB offers a variety of [features and subscriptions](https://mariadb.com/pricing/) that enable different types of hosting models, including **client/server, cloud, local, and embedded**.
* Lastly, MariaDB, like a few other databases I have found, can be accessed by Java by **downloading a driver** and opening the connection through a `localhost`. [This blogpost](https://mariadb.com/resources/blog/how-to-connect-java-applications-to-mariadb-using-jdbc/) details how to go about that process. In addition to that, [this documentation page](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-connector-j/) details many more connections and packages that can be used with Java.
