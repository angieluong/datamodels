# Apache Cassandra

* Apache Cassandra (NoSQL), as [seen here](https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html), is an **open-source** database. Though the answers seemed a bit convoluted at first, this database has a non-relational, key-value pair structure where the keys map to values in the form of columns. This combination of structures makes it a **multi-model** database. [This page](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/280929/why-cassandra-is-not-considered-a-relational-database) explains the exact distinction clearly.

* Like many other NoSQL databases, Apache Cassandra can be hosted in the client/server, cloud, local, and embedded models.

* This database can be accessed by Java and Python by downloading client drivers. [This documentation page](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cassandra/getting_started/drivers.html) details all the known Cassandra drivers and their corresponding languages. The database can then get accessed by running a script on the local machine.
