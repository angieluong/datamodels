# Microsoft SQL Server

* Microsoft SQL Server was one of the **relational** databases that I discovered while doing research for this assignment. It can be found at [this website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2022), which introduces SQL Server 2022. Commonly referred to as "SQL Server" by the websites that I came across, this is a **commercial** database.

* SQL Server has many different editions and supported features, which is made more complex through their various database versions. At [this SQL Server Editions & Features page], I discovered that SQL Server 2022's hosting capabilities include **client/server, cloud, local, and embedded**.

* In order to access it using Java, you are meant to **download a driver**, as detailed in this [Microsoft SQL documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/jdbc/step-1-configure-development-environment-for-java-development?view=sql-server-ver16). After downloading said JDBC Driver, we can then set the class path (which can change depending on which driver version we installed).
